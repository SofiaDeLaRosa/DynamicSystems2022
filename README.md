 ## Introduction
 A [fractal](https://fractalfoundation.org/resources/what-are-fractals/) is a mathematical structure that describes an infinite perimeter in a finite area.
 
 ## Metodology
 We drew a fractal in shape of square with iterations. That is a dynamic system because it is based on iterations.
 
 Toolset:

- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)

- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

 ## Requeriments
 
 We want to draw a fractal in shape of square with lenght = 1. We draw a square of 1/3 of the lenght of the sides of the main square, on each of its sides with each iteration.
 
 ## Running
 
 We have to clone the repository, creates a commit, make a pull request. The code is in the file called FractalCuadrado.
 
 ## Results
 
 Example of a Fractal in shape of square with the coordinates of origin of the square (0,0), lenght of its sides = 1, and 4 iterations.
